Now that you are connected to your workbench, let's make sure that all the expected services are responding properly in the cluster.

When you open your workbench you will see your "Launcher" tab:

. At the bottom of the page under "Other", click on "Terminal":

+
.. Run the following command configure your access to Azure AI services.

.. Note that since we are using workload identities, we need to annotate our service account with the correct managed identity in Azure, this will allow your workloads to authenticate directly to Azure Services without having to provide a password or secret-key.  The final command will restart your workbench, Feel free to close the tag and then re-open your workbench when it is running again.

cd
wget {azure_ai_info_url}
oc -n {user} annotate sa my-workbench \
  azure.workload.identity/client-id={user_assigned_identity_client_id}
oc -n {user} rollout restart statefulset my-workbench



.. Close the terminal.

. In the left hand navigation menu, navigate to the folder called: `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/02`

. Open the notebook called `02-05-validating.ipynb`

. If you have never executed Cells in a Jupyter Notebook before, here is what you need to do:

.. Click on the **Restart kernel and Run all Cells** link:

.. Click **Restart** :

. Running these cells will confirm that all the lab-required services are responding.

The output should look as follows:

[source,console]
----
Found Azure OpenAI Base Endpoint: https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/
Success: LLM Service-FlanT5 is reachable on llm-flant5.ic-shared-llm.svc.cluster.local:3000
----

If the output of this notebook looks suspicious, please inform the people leading the {ic}.

This is a summarized visualization of how the environment is laid out (in some workshops a local PostgreSQL database will be used instead of Azure PostgreSQL):
